# Python

This is a personal repository to display some of the important concepts of the Python language, storing standard code as well as projects to display to hiring managers.

I intend to build out a comphrehensive repository, encapsulating repeatable steps to improve efficiency with designated source code. 

>Short-Term
>>This project is taking place as I am learning more about Python, currently within my first 3 months of being introduced to the language, and looking to pivot my career into something which carries with it a substance for solving problems with code (Software Engineering / Data Science). I intend to house key concepts here. 

>Long-Term
>>My long-term goal is to work on AI and Machine Learning projects, lending a helping hand into the revolution in the 'information age'.
I have a vision of working on future interstellar projects, stretching from Earths atmosphere, to beyond.
I believe there is so much capability to be apart of enabling education for all people on Earth, minimising hunger, building dearly needed facilities and homes, working on highly technical exploratory missions both on Earth and through the Solar system. All of this at various times in my life I intend to offer my service to, using data to help us amalgamate data flows and help to provide a tangible outcomes for people across the planet.
Moreover, the world of AI has come so far since the 1940-50's... with still so much we don't know, and with AI being the next frontier, taking part in perhaps the most important development that our species has ever worked on - I want to be apart of the conversation as we develop closer and closer to levels of AGI (artificial general intelligence) and a key reason for shifting into this kind of work. 

>An exercise I ponder, answer this for yourself: If the human race could do one of these, which would you choose? 
>>A) A long life, 
>>B) To travel and explore space, 
>>C) To eradicate diseases, 
>>D) Zero deaths via Public Transport, 
>>E) Prevent Animal Extinction through tracking
>>F) Build a Superintelligent assistant
>>And what if I told you that one of these could solve all of the other issues we face in one fell swoop - if you chose F) you'd be correct.

Some books I have thoroughly enjoyed, inspiring me to embark on such a journey are the following:
> Life 3.0, Max Tegmark (2017)
>> This book deeply moved me, I remember listening to this for the first time on Audible by Amazon in my car driving home on my own from Forster, NSW, Australia. I remember barely moving an inch, or speaking a word along the entire 4 hours of my journey (aside from the odd "Wow" or "Geeeez" when the hook landed). The Tale of the OMEGA team is a brilliant way to get a quick download of what the book is generally about. This can be found either in a pretty cool video put together on Youtube: https://youtu.be/ttZSk7rmFvc, or in text form here: https://www.marketingfirst.co.nz/storage/2018/06/prelude-life-3.0-tegmark.pdf

> Mind Children, Hans Moravec (1988)
>> Astonishinly forsighted book, with wonderful detail of how computers began to where they can one day have capacity to take us. I realised I have a genuine interest in how things came to be the way they are, history has always fascintated me - and this book delivered on all fronts.
