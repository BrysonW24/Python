PROJECT 1 = Block Letters
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.
Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Py.

PROJECT 
Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. 
With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. 
You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.


#lovely loveseat
lovely_loveseat_description = 'Lovely Loveseat. Tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white.'
lovely_loveseat_price = 254 

#stylish settee
stylish_settee_description = 'Stylish Settee. Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black.'
stylish_settee_price = 180.50

#lamp 
luxurious_lamp_description = 'Luxurious Lamp. Glass and iron. 36 inches tall. Brown with cream shade.'
luxurious_lamp_price = 52.15

#sales tax is 8.8%
sales_tax = .088

#customer total counter
customer_one_total = 0
#empty string
customer_one_itemization = "" 

#purchase of the love seat
customer_one_total += 254
customer_one_itemization += lovely_loveseat_description

#purchase of the lamp
customer_one_total += 180.50
customer_one_itemization += luxurious_lamp_description
customer_one_tax = customer_one_total * sales_tax

customer_one_total += customer_one_tax


print('Customer One Items')
print(customer_one_itemization)
print('Customer One Total')
print(customer_one_total)
