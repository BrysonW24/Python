# Review -- To recap, we explored:
    # What problems arise in our programs without functions
    # What functions are and how to write them
    # How whitespace plays an important role in how a program will execute our code and more importantly distinguish function code from non-function code
    # How to pass input values into our functions using parameters and arguments
    # The difference between built-in and user-defined functions and some common built-in functions python offers
    # How we can reuse function output with the return keyword, as well as multiple returns.
    # Where variables can be accessed in our programs that use functions
    # Letâ€™s practice putting all these concepts together!
